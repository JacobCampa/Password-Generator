# Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to give the user an application to generate a random string of characters depending on the inputs to the prompts provided. The user will have full access to whether or not they want to use cerain character types and how long they would like thee password to be. I used this project as a way to learn and practice to javascript language and how it interacts with the webpage. 

## Usage

You can use this address in your url or click the link below to be directed to the webpage:

Using the image below, when you reach the webpage you will need to click on the "Generate Password" button on the screen. You will then go through a series of prompts on criteria required and once you completed those, a final prompt will appear to confirm and generate your new password. You can start over once completed as many times as you wouldlike.
